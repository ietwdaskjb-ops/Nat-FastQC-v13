# Nat-FastQC-v13
NAT v13.0 is a deterministic, invariant-preserving quality control extension for FastQC outputs that produces a numeric QC score, PASS/WARN/FAIL decision, and encoded render. The specification is frozen and seeking academic collaboration for blinded validation and review.
AI-assistec drafting was used in document preparation. All conceptual design decisions and incariant definitions are attributed to the project author.
